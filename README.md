### What is this?

This project is my personal attempt to test and showcase CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) skills using vanilla JavaScript and localStorage. The To-Do List Web App allows users to manage multiple to-do lists with their tasks. 

This web app allows you to create a group to-do list good for different kind of task categories. The task then saved in your browser's localStorage, so it won't be lost when you reload the page. However, clearing your browser's data will also delete the saved to-do list. To make the most of this web app, I recommended to use it with a browser extension that changes the new tab page.

### Features

- Create atleast 1000 list and can create multiple task for each list.
- Displays time and date with customizable background image.

- Supports mobile and large screen sizes.

Note: localStorage has a limit of 5MB and clearing your browser's data will also delete the storage. To make the most of this project, it is recommended to use it with a browser extension that changes the new tab page.
