  <h1>Using JavaScript (localStorage)</h1>
</div>

### What is this?

This project is my personal attempt to test and showcase CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) skills using vanilla JavaScript and localStorage. The To-Do List Web App allows users to manage multiple to-do lists with their tasks. 

This web app allows you to create a group to-do list good for different kind of task categories. The task then saved in your browser's localStorage, so it won't be lost when you reload the page. However, clearing your browser's data will also delete the saved to-do list. To make the most of this web app, I recommended to use it with a browser extension that changes the new tab page.

### Installation

To install the project, clone the repository to your local machine using Git or download the project as a ZIP file and extract it, then open the `index.html` file in your web browser. There are no additional dependencies or installation steps required.
